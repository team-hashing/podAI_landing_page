                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p class="content-slide">We are two 23-year-old Computer Science graduates from Spain, bound by our
                        shared passion for technology and a relentless drive to make a meaningful impact. Our journey
                        began in the classrooms and labs of our university, where our paths first crossed during our
                        degree. Little did we know that this meeting would spark the beginning of a partnership that
                        would lead us to create something truly extraordinary.</p>
                    <p class="content-slide">Together, we founded Team Hashing, a company born out of our shared vision
                        to innovate and bring our tech ideas to life. From the start, our mission has been clear: to
                        harness the power of technology to solve real-world problems and create experiences that
                        inspire.</p>
                    <p class="content-slide">Our journey hasn't been without its challenges, but each obstacle has only
                        fueled our determination. In 2022, our dedication paid off when we entered and won the IKEA
                        Hackathon. Competing against some of the brightest minds in the industry, our project stood out
                        for its creativity, technical prowess, and practical application.</p>
                    <p class="content-slide">Not content with just one victory, we continued to push the boundaries of
                        what's possible. In 2024, we once again found ourselves in the winner's circle—this time at the
                        Google Hackathon. This achievement not only solidified our reputation as innovators but also
                        affirmed our belief that with hard work, collaboration, and a little bit of boldness, we can
                        achieve anything we set our minds to.</p>
                    <p class="content-slide">Our journey has been a whirlwind of learning, growth, and incredible
                        experiences. We've faced tough challenges, celebrated big wins, and most importantly, we've
                        remained true to our core values every step of the way. As we continue to forge ahead, we're
                        excited to share our story with you and to bring even more groundbreaking ideas to life.</p>
                    <p class="content-slide">Thank you for being a part of our journey—this is just the beginning.</p>

                    <p class="content-slide">Our mission is to revolutionize the way content is created and consumed
                        through the power of artificial intelligence. With our AI podcast generator, we're breaking new
                        ground by allowing anyone to effortlessly generate high-quality podcast content on any topic,
                        anytime, anywhere. This tool represents our first step towards a future where AI plays a central
                        role in content creation, democratizing the process and making it more accessible, efficient,
                        and personalized for everyone.</p>
                    <p class="content-slide">We believe in the transformative potential of AI to reshape the media
                        landscape, empowering creators and listeners alike. By harnessing advanced technology, we aim to
                        eliminate barriers to content creation, enabling more voices to be heard and more stories to be
                        shared. Our vision is to create a world where AI not only assists but enhances human creativity,
                        opening up new possibilities for storytelling and communication.</p>
                    <p class="content-slide">This project is just the beginning. As we continue to innovate, our goal
                        remains clear: to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI, bringing the future of content
                        creation to the present.</p>

                        lasting effect on society.</p>
                    <p class="content-slide">These values are more than just words—they are the principles that define
                        us. As we continue to grow and innovate, we remain steadfast in our commitment to privacy,
